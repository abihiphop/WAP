            My name is Abrha Gebreslassie, I am 30 years old and born in <span>Tigray</span> region
            (Northern Ethiopia).Tigray is the land of the ancient Axum civilization and its people are symbolic on solidarity to thier unity which makes
            me proud of. In my country, it is natural for every child to contribute its own part on supporting the
            family especially if the economy of the family is agriculture based. Since my parents own small land area in
            a small village, I used to help them by taking care of my younger brother and sometimes look
            after our five to ten sheep as a shepherd in case my older siblings are assigned to other task. </br>
            I started school at age of six in 1996 and got my BSc in Information Technology in 2012. I have been in work for 6 years in before coming to USA.

                                        as king -- and as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn into a conflict
                                        that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery
                                        and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of
                                        Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.</span>

        <p class="bio">
            I am a 30 years old Abrha Gebreslassie born in <span>Wukro </span> city found in <span>Tigray</span> region
            (Northern Ethiopia) where the marvelous rock hewn <span>churches</span> are its touristic icon.Tigray is the
            land of the ancient Axum civilization and its people are symbolic on solidarity to thier unity which makes
            me proud of. In Ethiopia, it is natural for every child to contribute its own part on supporting the family
            especially if the economy of the family is agriculture based. Since my parents own small land area in a
            small village outside Wukro, I used to help them by taking care of my younger brother and sometimes look
            after our five to ten sheep as a shepherd in case my older siblings are assigned to other task. My parents
            are recognized by the society as best parents rising disciplined children. In fact every member of my family
            obeys what the society says it is right to do such as respecting our elders, helping someone in need,
            refraining from speaking odd words, doing good at education etc.

                                to take his rightful place as king.

                                        reappears, T'Challa's mettle
                                        as king -- and as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn into a conflict
                                        that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery
                                        and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of
                                        Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.</span>
